If I can see it, then i can do it
If I just belive it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think aout it every night and day
spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly (X3)

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me

If I can see it, then I can do it
If i just believe it, there's nothing to it
